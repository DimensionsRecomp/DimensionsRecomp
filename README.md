# LEGO Dimensions Decomp
A WIP decompiled version of LEGO Dimensions. LEGO Dimensions has been made for multiple platforms. These platforms are:

# Ports
This project **WILL NOT** focus on porting the game to other platforms at this time. This will change later down the line.

# Why Contribute?
While the game may not be "high-priority" over other games like Mario Party 4, contributing to the project would be appreciated.
